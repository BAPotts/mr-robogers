## Description
 
  This program takes a user-inputted number and displays a range of numbers from 0 to the inputted number. It will replace certain numbers with "Beep!", "Boop!", or "Won't you be my neighbor?" depending on if they contain a "1", "2" or "3", with numbers containing 3 always being translated to "Won't you be my neighbor?", numbers containing "2" being translated to "Boop!" unless they contain a "3", and numbers containing "1" being translated to "Beep!" unless they contain a 2 or a 3.
